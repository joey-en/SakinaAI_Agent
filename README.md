# Graph-RAG (GRAG): Embedding-Based Graph Navigation for Mental Health AI

This project builds a structured, semantic knowledge graph from sources like DSM-5 and uses it to support contextual chat interactions ‚Äî particularly for mental health support.

```bash
# activate existing venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# create a venv and install requirements if there is no existing venv
.\scripts\env_set_up.bat 
```

## 1. Creating a Knowledge Graph from DSM-5

The goal here is to turn a structured mental health reference (like DSM-5 or ICD-11) into a navigable knowledge graph.

### 1.1 **Parsing diagnoses DSM-5** 

   * Extract diagnoses and their metadata
   * Identify symptoms, criteria, treatments, duration, description, and related_diagnoses

  ```bash
  python src/document_parsing.py
  ```

  This will generate a JSON file in the following format:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "diagnosis": "Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering)",
      "aliases": [
        "Childhood-onset fluency disorder",
        "Developmental stuttering",
        "Stuttering"
        ],
      "symptoms": [
        "Sound and syllable repetitions",
        "Sound prolongations of consonants and vowels",
        "Broken words (pauses within a word)",
        "Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech)",
        "Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words)",
        "Words produced with an excess of physical tension",
        "Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions"
      ],
      "treatments": null,
      "duration": null,
      "description": [
        "Disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech.",
        "Interference with academic or occupational achievement or social communication."
      ],
      "related_diagnoses": {
        "Autism Spectrum Disorder": "Not better explained by...",
        "Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)": "Not better explained by..."
      }
    }, ...
  ]
  ```

  Optionally, running `src/alias_grouper.py` will make a normallzed name mapping in `src\saved_mappings\diagnosis_names.json` created a cleaned version of the original JSON

  ```bash
  python src/alias_grouper.py
  ```

  ```json
  [
  {
    "main": "Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)",
    "aliases": [
      "Intellectual Developmental Disorder",
      "Intellectual Disability"
    ]
  },
  {
    "main": "Childhood-onset fluency disorder (Stuttering)",
    "aliases": [
      "Childhood-onset fluency disorder",
      "Developmental stuttering",
      "Stuttering"
    ]
  },...
  ]
  ```

### 1.2. **Building Nodes and Edges** (üü¢ON-GOING)

  * Transform the cleaned DSM-5 JSON data into a local Neo4j Knowledge Graph
  * Each concept (diagnosis, symptom, treatment) becomes a node
  * Link nodes (e.g. `GAD --has_symptom‚Üí Restlessness`)


  #### Neo4j connection

  ```bash
  # You can test the connection by running:
  python trials/3_neo4j_connection.py
  ```

  * Instance: `DSM5_KG`
  * Database: `dsm5`
  * Neo4j version: `2025.06.2`
  * Bolt connection: `neo4j://127.0.0.1:7687`

  #### Load JSON and populate KG

  ```bash
  python src/graph_creation.py
  ```

  * Loads from `./src./saved_json./DSM_5_full.json`
  * Build nodes and edges into the `dsm5` database


  You can explore the graph visually in Neo4j Desktop or run Cypher queries directly in the browser at [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).

## 2. Chatbot Query Flow

This layer connects the graph to an LLM, turning user queries into meaningful replies using graph traversal.

### Query Flow

```
User ‚Üí input text
‚Üì
Embed query (SBERT or similar)
‚Üì
Match top nodes using cosine similarity
‚Üì
Traverse nearby nodes (1‚Äì2 hops)
‚Üì
Compile info into a prompt
‚Üì
LLM (e.g. FANAR) generates reply
‚Üì
Reply returned and stored in chat history
```

### Example

**User:** ‚ÄúI keep getting panic attacks randomly and I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù

* Matching nodes:

  * Symptom: Panic Attacks
  * Diagnosis: Panic Disorder
  * Treatments: CBT, Breathing Exercises, SSRIs

* Traversal:

  * Panic Disorder ‚Üí has\_symptom ‚Üí Panic Attacks
  * Panic Disorder ‚Üí treated\_by ‚Üí CBT, SSRIs
  * Panic Attacks ‚Üí managed\_by ‚Üí Breathing Techniques

* LLM prompt (example fragment):

```
User is experiencing frequent panic attacks.

Related context:
- Diagnosis: Panic Disorder
- Treatments: CBT, breathing techniques, medication

Please respond with supportive, informative guidance.
```

### Stored Data

* Chat history
* Node matches and traversal logs
* User-specific context (if any)

## 3. Storing and Using Patient Data

This part personalises the chatbot‚Äôs behaviour using structured data tied to user records.

### Data Types

| Type            | Storage Format                       | Notes                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Diagnosis       | Graph: `User123 has_diagnosis ‚Üí GAD` | Connected to knowledge graph       |
| Symptoms        | Graph: `User123 reports ‚Üí Fatigue`   | Optionally time-stamped            |
| Journaling logs | Plaintext chunks                     | Can be embedded and indexed        |
| Medications     | Dict or graph                        | Example: `prescribed ‚Üí Sertraline` |
| Past chats      | JSON / SQLite                        | Used for context memory            |
| Appointments    | Optional calendar system             | External or internal scheduling    |

### Sample Use in Query

**User:** ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the meds are helping anymore.‚Äù

Retrieved context:

* Medication: Sertraline
* Diagnosis: GAD
* Timeline: Started 2 weeks ago

Prompt example:

```
User has been on Sertraline for 2 weeks for GAD. Today they report doubts about its effectiveness.

Generate a supportive reply that acknowledges concerns and offers next-step advice.
```
