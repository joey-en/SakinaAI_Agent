See all diagnosis nodes
```cypher
MATCH (d:Diagnosis)
RETURN d.name
LIMIT 50
```

See all relationships
```cypher
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
RETURN a.name, type(r), b.name
LIMIT 50
```

Show symptoms of a specific diagnosis
```cypher
MATCH (d:Diagnosis {name: "Depression"})-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom)
RETURN s.name
```

Find diagnoses for a given symptom
```cypher
MATCH (s:Symptom {name: "Insomnia"})<-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]-(d:Diagnosis)
RETURN d.name
```

See related diagnoses
```cypher
MATCH (d:Diagnosis {name: "Depression"})-[:RELATED_TO]->(rd:Diagnosis)
RETURN rd.name
```

Count how many symptoms each diagnosis has
```cypher
MATCH (d:Diagnosis)-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]->(s:Symptom)
RETURN d.name, COUNT(s) AS numSymptoms
ORDER BY numSymptoms DESC
```

Fuzzy search (if you store alternate names or acronyms)
You‚Äôll need a property like `aliases: ["MDD", "Major Depressive Disorder"]`

```cypher
MATCH (d:Diagnosis)
WHERE "MDD" IN d.aliases
RETURN d.name
```


Match multiple symptoms to a possible diagnosis
Example: User says they have "fatigue", "loss of appetite", and "insomnia"

```cypher
MATCH (s:Symptom)<-[:HAS_SYMPTOM]-(d:Diagnosis)
WHERE s.name IN ["Fatigue", "Loss of appetite", "Insomnia"]
RETURN d.name, COUNT(*) AS matchScore
ORDER BY matchScore DESC
```
