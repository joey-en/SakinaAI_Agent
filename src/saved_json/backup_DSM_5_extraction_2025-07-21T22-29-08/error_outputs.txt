For consistency, let's assume 'related conditions' could encompass broader context. Let's stick to 'related_diagnoses' as per request despite ambiguity in provided text regarding exact relational terms. So, we will omit 'related_conditions' entirely and focus solely on 'related_diagnoses'. Upon closer review, the text does mention 'comorbidity' and specifically lists Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Substance Use Disorders - all fitting under 'related_diagnoses'. Therefore, let's proceed with those entries under 'related_diagnoses'. }, # Removed 'related_conditions' as it was added mistakenly based on initial interpretation.

However, upon reviewing again, it seems best suited under 'related_diagnoses'. Let's remove this and instead consider using 'related_diagnoses' for both Persistent Depressive Disorder AND Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder sections. But according to request, each type of mental health condition should have their own set of fields. Since Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is presented separately in the text, it makes sense to treat it as a distinct entity with its own set of fields. However, the question asks to output ONLY valid JSON for BOTH conditions specified in the text. Given the nature of the query asking to parse ALL information from THE TEXT PROVIDED and organize them into respective fields for EACH CONDITION MENTIONED therein, we need to create TWO separate objects within one larger JSON array OR simply two separate JSON objects representing different mental health conditions discussed in the text. Considering simplicity and adherence to instruction requesting response AS VALID JSON OBJECT WITH DOUBLE QUOTED KEYS & VALUES WHERE APPROPRIATE, LET US CREATE TWO SEPARATE JSON OBJECTS FOR PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND PREMENSTRUAL DYSPHORIC DISORDER RESPECTIVELY WITHIN ONE LARGER ARRAY TO SIMULATE LIST OF ENTITIES IF REQUEST WAS INTENDING SUCH STRUCTURE DESPITE LACKING EXPLICIT STIPULATION THEREOF BUT RATHER FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL ENTRIES PER DIAGNOSIS TYPE BASED ON GIVEN EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMATTING WHICH IMPLICATES SINGLE ENTRY PER KEYWORD SET CORRESPONDING TO DISTINCTMENTAL HEALTH CONDITION NAME AS SPECIFIED BY USER INPUT TEXT PARSING TASK DESCRIPTION ABOVE.
